# Title
Milestone Project 1
User Centric Front-End
Development


## Description

* It is a website for a small gym. It is a simple and self-explanatory site where its main purpose is to grab the attention of the individual who is looking to address their fitness and health questions, while also gaining more members/ clients for the gym.

## User Experience (UX)

### First Time Visitor Goals

* As a First Time Visitor - I don’t want to be bogged down with jargon that confuses more than helps me, and does not answer my needs.
* As a First Time Visitor - I don’t want to be pressured to interact, just have the facts that will help me make a decision or seek further assistance. I want to be able to easily navigate throughout the site to find content.
* As a First Time Visitor – I want links to social media where I can make further investigations before deciding to become a member or also see the benefits of being a member.

### Returning/Frequent Visitor Goals

* As a Returning Visitor – I want to see possible new additions to the website such as rewards or offers.
* As a Returning Visitor - I want to search social media links to be part of the community and keep up with like-minded individuals, see if there are any changes to services or special activities. 
* As a Returning Visitor – I would like to find the best ways to contact the gym if I have issues that need to be discussed.


## Design

### Colour Scheme

* The main colours used are blue (#19b0f7) aubergine (#4b293c) white (#fafafa) and a slight use of pink (rgb(187, 46, 128), black (#000000) and DarkGray. They have been chosen as the colours of the gym to show modernity and accessibility. 

### Typography

* The two interchanging fonts on this site are RobotoMono and Oswald as they provide clear easy to read text ideal for the subject matter.

### Imagery

* Imagery has been chosen to catch the eye but not be overpowering. They have been chosen again to showing modernity and accessibility. 


## Wireframes

* Balsmaiq Wireframe  - {I Have unfortunately been unable to attach the initial wireframe plan} My initial ideas did slightly differ from the end product but the original layout and choice of images remained very similar. 

## Features

* Responsive on all device sizes – Fully responsive on desktop. Responsive on most tablets and mobiles.

* The interactive elements if the site include links to three social media sites, a form for the potential client to become a member, and a section for existing members to see their fitness progress and promotional rewards on offer (The sign-in section of the page has not been set up in this example)

                   There is a short testimonial section, but also three social media links that will connect with others in the community who can supply up to date reviews and offer advice on the products on offer and their benefits.


### Returning/Frequent User Goals

        There will be a rewards page where the gym and their affiliated companies will provide promotional rewards to existing members for reaching goals.

* As a Returning Visitor - I want to search social media links to be part of the community and keep up with like-minded individuals, see if there are any changes to services or special activities = 
                There are links to three social media pages/groups allowing the visitor (member or not) to connect with others and view the latest news and events from the gym.

                           Contact information is located on the page, these include the location address, phone number, email address and social media links.


## Credits

### Code

* Bootstrap4: Slightly used to make the site responsive.

* Reviewing and revisit lessons from the HTML and CSS section of the course via [Code Institute] 

* The tutors at Code Institute
### Content

* All content was written by the developer.

### Media

* Three Images were found on [www.unsplash.com]

* One image found on [www.piaxabay.com]

* The images used were by the photographers:
                . Sven Mieke: Heading background image.
                . Risen Wang: Join section background image.

## Bugs and Issues

* Unaware of any current major bugss or issues that would hinder the operation of the site.

* With hardly any previous experience of coding in practice, and having never used GitHub or Bootstrap (or any of the other software and websites involved), this first milestone did prove a challenge. After many hours of work the biggest issues were still the linking of files within GitHub, and also the responsive design on mobile and tablet. Hopefully the frequent use of GitHub and further experimentation with code will make these issues much easier to resolve in future.
