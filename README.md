## Description

* It is a website for a small gym (Our Gym). It is a simple and self-explanatory site where its main purpose is to grab the attention of the individual who is looking to address their fitness and health questions, while also gaining more members/ clients for the gym.

## User Experience (UX)

### First Time Visitor Goals

* As a First Time Visitor - I don’t want to be bogged down with jargon that confuses more than helps me, and does not answer my needs.
* As a First Time Visitor - I don’t want to be pressured to interact, just have the facts that will help me make a decision or seek further assistance. I want to be able to easily navigate throughout the site to find content.
* As a First Time Visitor – I want links to social media where I can make further investigations before deciding to become a member or also see the benefits of being a member.

### Returning/Frequent Visitor Goals

* As a Returning Visitor – I want to see possible new additions to the website such as rewards or offers.
* As a Returning Visitor - I want to search social media links to be part of the community and keep up with like-minded individuals, see if there are any changes to services or special activities. 
* As a Returning Visitor – I would like to find the best ways to contact the gym if I have issues that need to be discussed.


## Design

### Colour Scheme

## Bugs and Issues

* Unaware of any current major bugss or issues that would hinder the operation of the site.

* With hardly any previous experience of coding in practice, and having never used GitHub or Bootstrap (or any of the other software and websites involved), this first milestone did prove a challenge. After many hours of work the biggest issues were still the linking of files within GitHub, and also the responsive design on mobile and tablet. Hopefully the frequent use of GitHub and further experimentation with code will make these issues much easier to resolve in future.
