# Title
Milestone Project 1
User Centric Front-End
Development


## Description

* It is a website for a small gym. It is a simple and self-explanatory site where its main purpose is to grab the attention of the individual who is looking to address their fitness and health questions, while also gaining more members/ clients for the gym.

## User Experience (UX)

### First Time Visitor Goals

* As a First Time Visitor - I don’t want to be bogged down with jargon that confuses more than helps me, and does not answer my needs.
* As a First Time Visitor - I don’t want to be pressured to interact, just have the facts that will help me make a decision or seek further assistance. I want to be able to easily navigate throughout the site to find content.
* As a First Time Visitor – I want links to social media where I can make further investigations before deciding to become a member or also see the benefits of being a member.

### Returning/Frequent Visitor Goals

* As a Returning Visitor – possible new additions or rewards.
* As a Returning Visitor - I want to search social media links to be part of the community and keep up with changes. 
* As a Returning Visitor – I would like to find the best ways to contact if I have issues that need to be discussed.


## Design

### Colour Scheme

* The main colours used are blue (#19b0f7) aubergine (#4b293c) white (#fafafa) and a slight use of pink (rgb(187, 46, 128) and black (#000000).

### Typography

* The two interchanging fonts on this site are RobotoMono and Oswald as they provide clear easy to read text ideal for the subject matter.

### Imagery

* Imagery has been chosen to catch the eye but not be overpowering. They have been chosen as the no-nonsense approach of the gym and to show modernity and accessibility. 


## Wireframes

* Balsmaiq Wireframe 

## Features

* Responsive on all device sizes – responsive only to desktop at the moment. Having never used Bootstrap or the @media queries this process was difficult to master in a short time.

* The interactive elements if the site include links to three social media sites and a form for the potential client to become a member.

## Languages Used

* HTML5
* CSS3

## Frameworks, Libraries & Programs Used

* Bootstrap 4.4.1:

* Google Fonts: Google Fonts was used for the Roboto Mono and Oswald fonts.

* Font Awesome: Font Awesome was used for all icons on this page.

* Git: Git was used for version control by utilizing the Gitpod terminal to commit to Git and Push to GitHub.

* GitHub: GitHub is used to store the project code after being pushed from Git.

* Balsamiq: - Balsamiq was used to create the wireframe 

* Unsplash.com:  - All images were obtained from this site.

## Testing

* W3C Markup Validator and W3C CSS Validator were used to validate the project. 

## Testing User Stories from User Experience (UX) Section

### First Time/Returning Visitor Goals

* As a First Time Visitor - I don’t want to be bogged down with jargon that confuses more than helps me, does not answer y needs = 
                         The hero image will allow the user to immediately understand the purpose of the site. There is a navigation bar to direct them to other areas of the page.

* As a First Time Visitor -  I don’t want to be pressured to interact, just have the facts that will help me make a decision or seek further assistance. I want to be able to easily navigate throughout the site to find content = 
                 The site is easy to navigate, and the decision to go further is left to the user.

* As a First Time Visitor, I want links to social media where I can make further investigations before deciding to become a member or also see the benefits of being a member = 
                   There is a short testimonial section, but also three social media links that will connect with others in the community who can supply up to date reviews and offer advice on the products on offer and their benefits.


## Credits

### Code

* Bootstrap4: Used to make the site responsive.

* Reviewing and revisit lessons from the HTML and CSS section of the course via [Code Institute] 

### Content

* All content was written by the developer.

### Media

* All Images were found on [www.unsplash.com]

* The images used were by the photographers:
                * Sven Mieke – Hero image.
                * Risen Wang – Join section image.
                * Zachary Kadolph – Form image.


## Bugs and Issues

* With hardly any previous experience of coding in practice, and having never used GitHub or Bootstrap before, this first milestone did prove a challenge. After many hours of work the biggest issues were still the linking of files within GitHub, responsive design on mobile and tablet. Hopefully the frequent use of GitHub and further experimentation with code will make these issues much easier to resolve in future.
